# Library-Management-System
A Java swing-based library management system with MySQL as its database management system.

Developed a library management system using Java and its Swing features. The system enables librarians to manage books,
borrowers, and loan transactions effectively. Implemented features include searching and sorting books, managing borrower 
information, issuing and returning books, and generating reports. The system has an intuitive user interface that enhances 
user experience.This project helped improve my proficiency in Java programming, as well as my problem-solving 
and project management skills.
